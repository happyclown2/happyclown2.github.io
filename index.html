    <h1>Why you shouldn't read: The Testing</h1>
    <h2>By Joelle Charbonneau</h2>
    <p>
        There are many different books that I have read in my lifetime, and I can say for certain that this is one of the ones that has not been that fun. This is one of those books that I wouldn't reccomend to another friend to read, and I have good reasons why.

        The book has terrible pacing.

        I know that Joelle was trying to make a story, and i understand. The only thing i dont understand is why it takes 10 pages to talk about a trip inside of a car. This is one of my worst pet peeves about books. The plot may be interesting, but the amount of pages it takes to get to that level is way too many. I don't want to spend 50 pages learning about the family, I just want to get to the good stuff.

        Too much story
    </h2>
    <p id="p2">
        I know that the plot is the main driving force of a book, but sometimes there becomes so much story that it gets unenjoyable. There are so many examples of unrelated situations in the book that take up 5 pages of the book. It's the equivalent to putting a bunch of random things on an essay to reach the word requirement.

        Predictable characters
    </h2>
    <p id="p3">
        I'm fine with characters having a repetitive gimmick that makes the character in the book, some can pull it off. Joelle can't. I imagine Joelle searching up top 10 personality traits to give to your characters and just copy pasting it into her book.

       Untold plot 
    </h2>
    <p id="p4">
        I know that there's a trilogy that explains the story, but why would I read the trilogy, when I didn't even enjoy the first book. I felt like most of the story was unnecesary. It's the equivalent to watching a 20 minute youtube video, just for it to have a 3 minute sponsor.

        Too serious
    </h2>
    <p id="p5">
        I like dramas, i love to read (and especially watch) them. But sprinkling in some other forms of media in all the seriousness is also an important part, and this book does none of that. Just a little bit of romance and that's it. This book is like somebody that can only talk in a monotone voice.
