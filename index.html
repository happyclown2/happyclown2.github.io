    <h1>Why you shouldn't read: The Testing</h1>
    <h2>By Joelle Charbonneau</h2>
    <p>
        There are many different books that I have read in my lifetime, and I can say for certain that this is one of the ones that has not been that fun. This is one of those books that I wouldn't reccomend to another friend to read, and I have good reasons why.

        The book has terrible pacing.
    </h2>
    <p id="p1">
        I know that Joelle was trying to make a story, and i understand. The only thing i dont understand is why it takes 10 pages to talk about a trip inside of a car. This is one of my worst pet peeves about books. The plot may be interesting, but the amount of pages it takes to get to that level is way too many. I don't want to spend 50 pages learning about the family, I just want to get to the good stuff.

        Too much story
    </h2>
    <p id="p2">
        I know that the plot is the main driving force of a book, but sometimes there becomes so much story that it gets unenjoyable. There are so many examples of unrelated situations in the book that take up 5 pages of the book. It's the equivalent to putting a bunch of random things on an essay to reach the word requirement.

        Predictable characters
    </h2>
    <p id="p3">
        I'm fine with characters having a repetitive gimmick that makes the character in the book, some can pull it off. Joelle can't. I imagine Joelle searching up top 10 personality traits to give to your characters and just copy pasting it into her book.

       Untold plot 
    </h2>
    <p id="p4">
        I know that there's a trilogy that explains the story, but why would I read the trilogy, when I didn't even enjoy the first book. I felt like most of the story was unnecesary. It's the equivalent to watching a 20 minute youtube video, just for it to have a 3 minute sponsor.

        Too serious
    </h2>
    <p id="p5">
        I like dramas, i love to read (and especially watch) them. But sprinkling in some other forms of media in all the seriousness is also an important part, and this book does none of that. Just a little bit of romance and that's it. This book is like somebody that can only talk in a monotone voice.

        Stuck on one genre
    </h2>
    <p>
        I like a little variation in a book. Whether it's in the form of comedy, or horror. This book did nothing of that. There were some attempts at romance, but it was a very bad attempt. It felt akward and weird, the characters were just felt emotionless throughout.

        Unneeded family
    </h2>
    <p>
        The family of the main character was a nice addition, but did almost nothing except add to the story of the book. Im sure that the other 2 books published would explain lots, but I felt like the family was just there to waste the first 50 pages of the book. It kind of disappointed me the family didn't have much to do with the book, they seemed like a cool addition.

        Quality slowly became worse
    </h2>
    <p>
        My inital reaction to the book was surprised. I expected this to be a good book that would be refreshing to the brain. It wasn't. After the first 100 pages, it's just fighting, drama, fighting, drama, with a little romance sprinkled inbetween. Something went wrong inbetween. Joelle must have had some brain fart that limited her artistic capacity, because the rest of the book was bland.

        Even with the tone of the book, I felt no emotion
    </h2>
    <p>
        I have read many books where I have felt sad, happy, books where I laughed. This book had me with a straight face the whole time. All of the characters felt, as I said before, monotone. There was no effort put into character design, and that is a mortally influential part of a book that makes it fun. When I read a book, I want to at least feel some kind of remorse to the characters. These characters felt like they had no soul, it's as if they were really bad actors reading off their script lines for the first time.

        Too cheesy at moments
    </h2>
    <p>
        I like having some cringy moments in books that I can wince at once, maybe even show my friends, and keep reading my book. This book was a cheese fest. There were so many moments that made me want to not read the book. The worst moments were the romance scenes. It can be really hard to pull off a romance scene in a book, even the best romance books make me wince a little, the testing definetly made me cringe much more. So much cheese that I feel like i've been constipated for the past ten years.

        Overused concept
    </h2>
    <p>
        I know this may sound stupid, lots of stuff I like is overused. The only difference between what I like and this book is that my stuff has it's own little gimmick to it, this has none of that. This book left me dryer than a saltine cracker. There was no effort at all going into the idea. It's so simple, I could explain it in one sentence. Girl gets accepted into a big test where she finds out it's not just a school test and ends up fighting, with a little bit of romance to make you and your friends giggle.

        My review of this book may be harsh, but my expectations going in were high. I wasn't expecting to be agape by the exhilarating literature piece that I chose, but I also wasn't expecting a excruciatingly tiresome reading experience. It definetly wasn't the worst book I read, but it's definetly up there.
